# NHL-schedule-analyzer

This is a script I use to analyze the NHL's schedule for each team.

Inspired by an upset Toronto Maple Leafs fan that thought the Leafs played far too many back to backs.
I plan to expand this script beyond this one capability into a multi-use tool to analyze the NHL's schedule (perhaps it'll be useful for fantasy hockey, etc.)
